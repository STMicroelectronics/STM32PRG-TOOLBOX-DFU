# PRG-TOOLBOX-DFU

This project is an open-source tool that automates the preparation of STM32MP devices through the DFU protocol by initializing external RAM, fusing OTP memory and running U-Boot in Fastboot mode. 
The best part is that it achieves the startup of Fastboot mode without requiring any manual HW setting thanks to the U-Boot script.

The project is a wrapper tool of dfu-util, specifically designed for STM32MP products.
